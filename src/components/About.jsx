          <p>
            Iâ€™m Meet Kapadia, a passionate and forward-thinking B.Tech student in Computer & Information Technology (2022â€“2026) from Symbiosis University of Applied Sciences, with a strong academic 
            record (CGPA: 8.9). I specialize in building real-time systems, developer dashboards, and intuitive UI/UX interfaces that merge performance with aesthetic clarity.
          </p>
          <p>
            From architecting live power monitoring dashboards with .NET WebSockets and Angular, 
            to designing mobile and desktop apps with a keen sense of user flow â€” I thrive where technology meets 
            user experience. My journey includes internships at HKRP Innovations Limited and Infosys Springboard, 
            where I worked with RabbitMQ, Chart.js, LiveCharts, and full-stack APIs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I bring a rare mix of technical agility, problem-solving mindset, and a constant drive to learn and 
            innovate. Whether itâ€™s building futuristic dashboards, visualizing data, or debugging complex backend logic â€” 
            I build with clarity, precision, and impact.
